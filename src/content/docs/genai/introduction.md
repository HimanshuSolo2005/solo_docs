# Introduction to Course

Welcome to the **Building RAG Agents with LLMs** course. This training provides a comprehensive guide to designing, implementing, and evaluating retrieval-augmented systems that combine the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with retrieval pipelines.

Below is an overview of the key concepts and motivations for this course.

## üß† What Are Large Language Models?

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** are neural networks trained on massive datasets to understand and generate human-like text. They form the backbone of modern Generative AI applications, such as:

- Conversational agents
- Text summarization
- Code generation
- Search augmentation

Examples of popular LLMs include:
- OpenAI GPT-3 and GPT-4
- Anthropic Claude
- Meta LLaMA
- NVIDIA NeMo

## üîç What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

While LLMs are powerful, they have limitations:

- Their **knowledge is frozen at training time**.
- They may **hallucinate** incorrect information.
- They struggle with **domain-specific knowledge**.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** addresses these issues by:

1. **Retrieving** relevant documents or data chunks from an external knowledge base.
2. **Augmenting** the LLM prompt with retrieved context.
3. **Generating** a grounded, more accurate response.

This approach combines:
- **Semantic search** (using embeddings and vector stores)
- **Prompt engineering** (to blend retrieved knowledge with user queries)

## üèóÔ∏è What Will You Learn?

Throughout this course, you will:

‚úÖ Set up an environment with Jupyter Labs, Docker, and supporting services.  
‚úÖ Use LLM APIs to build foundational pipelines.  
‚úÖ Master **LangChain** to create chains, workflows, and retrieval logic.  
‚úÖ Load and process documents with chunking strategies.  
‚úÖ Generate and store embeddings for semantic similarity search.  
‚úÖ Evaluate your RAG pipelines with **LLM-as-a-Judge** approaches.  
‚úÖ Build end-to-end applications using Gradio interfaces.

## üí° Why Does RAG Matter?

RAG is becoming a **standard pattern** in production AI systems:

- **Enterprise Search:** Employees can query company knowledge bases.
- **Legal/Medical Assistants:** Retrieve verified documents to support answers.
- **Code Assistants:** Reference documentation and repositories.
- **Chatbots:** Answer questions using up-to-date or proprietary content.

By the end of this training, you‚Äôll be able to design RAG systems **from scratch**, including retrieval, orchestration, and evaluation.

## ‚ú® Course Prerequisites

To get the most from this material, you should have:

- **Intermediate Python knowledge** (functions, classes, virtual environments).
- Familiarity with **APIs** and basic web engineering.
- Basic understanding of **Machine Learning** concepts.
- Some exposure to LLMs or frameworks like LangChain (helpful but optional).
